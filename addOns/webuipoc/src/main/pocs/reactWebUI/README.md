# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Development
To build locally, you should have Node configured and `NODE_ENV` variable set to `development` (it should be set by default).
Use command `npm run start` to run the application.
